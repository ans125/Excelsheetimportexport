If you want to use excel file import export feature without any external library use this code it will not any phpspreadsheet library or any other external library it simply generate excel import export feature.It will only work with xlsx and csv format.I have used php core concepts in this project.
Change the database name according to your need here is database details
"database name "phpsheet" table name "students"
this is enitites"id primary key ,auto increment
,fullname
,email
,phone
,course".
